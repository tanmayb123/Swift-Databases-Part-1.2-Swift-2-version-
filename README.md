NOTE: THIS VERSION OF SWIFT DATABASES USES... ALAMOFIRE AND SWIFTYJSON!

This is the code (PHP & Swift/iOS end) for the iOS database connectivity App I created earlier.

This App allows you to connect to an online database(mySQL) from Swift (AlamoFire and SwiftyJSON), using PHP. You may edit all this code and use it for yourself.

To make this work, follow these steps:

1) Adjust the PHP end to work with your website

2) Upload the PHP end to your website

3) Adjust the iOS end to work with your PHP

4) Try it out!
